2. Upload the NN_sample.ipynb to Jupyter notebook (or google colab) and see if you can
understand the code. Add the following text cell and the code cell to the notebook and run it
again.
1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?
* More nodes = more parameters (weights), allowing the network to learn more complex patterns
Can capture intricate relationships in data that simpler networks might miss
Training becomes slower
Requires more memory to store additional weights
May need more training data to properly tune all parameters


2. Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase? 
* When there are too Few Nodes, there is a ow accuracy: The network lacks capacity to learn meaningful patterns like 60-70% accuracy
when there are moderate Nodes, Network gains enough capacity to model true patterns meaning it is a rapid improvement in accuracy as of 90-95% accuracy
If many more nodes are used,  Additional nodes provide smaller accuracy improvements, but gain only 1-2% accuracy
